Hi, my name is Jun.

I like to learn new things and programming is one of the many. I majored in 'economics', and I am very fancinated about programming languages. Currently studying about JAVA, but I also wish to learn to use python. I wish to continue on studying programming languages, and possibly have career on IT field with base of my economics knowledge.
